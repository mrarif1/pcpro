Hi guys , happy republic day to all of you my dear sisters , teachers  , and my dear  friends.
Republic Day  honours the date on which the Constitution of India came into effect on 26 January 1950 replacing the Government of India Act (1935) as the governing document of India.   
History of Republic day:     
INDIA achieved independence from British Raj on 15 August 1947 following the Indian independence movement.The independence came through the Indian Independence Act 1947 (10 & 11 Geo 6 c 30), an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that partitioned British India into the two new independent Dominions of the British Commonwealth (later Commonwealth of Nations). India obtained its independence on 15 August 1947 as a constitutional monarchy with George VI as head of state and the Earl Mountbatten as governor-general. The country, though, did not yet have a permanent constitution; instead its laws were based on the modified colonial Government of India Act 1935. On 29 August 1947, a resolution was moved for the appointment of Drafting Committee, Drafting Committee was appointed to draft a permanent constitution, with Dr B R Ambedkar as chairman. While India's Independence Day celebrates its freedom from British Rule, the Republic Day celebrates the coming into force of its constitution. A draft constitution was prepared by the committee and submitted to the Constituent Assembly on 4 November 1947.
 
As you all know. It is that on 15 Aug 1947 the country was freed from the British yoke after the sacrifice of thousands of patriots.Thereafter Indian resources and law and order came into force in my own country of 26 January 1950.My brother and sister had become free for this liberty, thousands of mothers in the lap of their mother – in – law, thousands of daughters out of bounds. After some great sacrifice the country had attained independence.
Dear sisters and brothers supreme worship Mahatma Gandhi, subhas chandra bose, nana rao the queen of jhansi and sardar vallabha patel Like the sacrifices that have dreamed of a free India. This was not of the kind of freedom that we understood the meaning of freedom.

Once again THANK YOU all to my dear  SISTERS , TEACHERS  and my dear FRIENDS.
